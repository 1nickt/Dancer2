This is the prototype for Dancer2

You can test it with:

  $ perl -Ilib ./contrib/test.pl

Also the progress of the DSL migration can be checked with ./progress.sh

And the test coverage ./cover.sh

*************** FEEDBACK WANTED ******************

The best way to help us with Dancer2 is to test it on existing real-life
applications.

You will certainly find something that doesnot work out-of-the box with this
prototype, then send me a report via GitHub's private message service.

Thanks.
